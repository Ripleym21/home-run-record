    Barry Bonds holds the all-time home run record in Major League Baseball
    Sadaharu Oh, pictured here in 2006, holds the officially verified all-time world home run record
     in professional baseball.
    New York Met player Tommie Agee hit a home run as far as up in section 48 at the former Shea Stadium
     on April 10, 1969.
      In baseball, a home run (abbreviated HR) is scored when the ball is hitin s
     uch a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home safely in one play
     without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process. In modern baseball,
     the feat is 
     typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles (
     or making contact with either foul pole) without first touching the ground,[1] resulting in
     an automatic home run. There is also the "inside-the-park" home 
     run where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field.
